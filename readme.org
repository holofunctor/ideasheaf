*Ideasheaf* is a collection of notes, exercises, and miscellaneous writings in mathematics and computer science. Inspired by the [[https://stacks.math.columbia.edu][Stacks project]] and [[https://ncatlab.org][nLab]], it aims to serve as a structured and cross-referenced wiki — primarily for private use, but shared as open knowledge.

The name /ideasheaf/ is drawn from the mathematical notion of the [[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sheaf+of+ideals][ideal sheaf]].
